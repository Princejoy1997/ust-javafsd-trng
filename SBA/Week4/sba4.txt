Features
-----------

1. Lambda Expression.

3. Stream API.
4. Default Methods.
5. Functional Interfaces.
6. Static Methods.
7. Optional Class.
8. ForEach().
9. Collectors Class.
10. JDBC enhancement etc.


* LAMBDA EXPRESSION
--------------------
Lambda expression was introduced to favour the functional interface and helps us to write the code in functional style.
It is a short block of code which takes in parameters and returns a value.
Lambda expressions are similar to methods, but they do not need a name and they can be implemented right in the body of a method.
Lambda expression contains mainly 3 sections.
  a) () : Paramaters.
  b) -> : Lambda Expression symbol
  c) () : Body

* Functional Interface
----------------------
Functional interface are the interface which exactly has only ONE ABSTRACT METHOD.


* Method Reference
------------------
Method reference is used to point/refer to the functional interface method.
Types of Method Reference:
  a) Reference to a Static method.
  b) Reference to a Instance method.
  c) Reference to a Constructor.


* Stream API
-------------
Streaming:
 
It is a transfer/continous flow of data from source to destination without being modified or persisted.
A Stream in JAVA 8 can be defined as the sequence of elements from a source to destination.
Stream does not store the elements.
It simply performs the aggregate operations to get the desired stream of data.
Aggregate operations that we perform on the collection, array or any other data source do not change the data of the source, they simply return a new stream.

* Optional
-----------
Optional is a class newly introduced as a part of java 8. It is used to deal with NullPointerException.


* Default and Static Methods
------------------------------
In older Java interface we cannot declare a function which cannot be defined in the implemented class.
As a part of Java 8, In functional interface we can implement Default and Static method in it.

* forEach()
------------
This method is used to Iterate over collections and streams in Java.
We can also use method reference in the forEach method.
It is a default method defined in the Iterable interface.
Collection classes which extends Iterable interface can use forEach() method to iterate elements
Using forEach() method we will Iterate through all elements and print to console using lambda expression as well as method reference.

* Collectors class
--------------------
Collectors is a final class that extends the object class which provided reduction operations, such as accumulationg elements into collections,summerizing elements according to various criteria etc..
